Advancements in technology have greatly enhanced electric vehicles (EVs). Numerous brands have introduced a diverse range of models, each boasting unique features such as rapid charging capabilities, impressive acceleration, and extended electric range. This competitive landscape drives manufacturers to continually refine these aspects to meet consumer demands and achieve greater efficiency. As companies release new models, the demand for EVs in the market tends to increase.

This condition rises a question, can releasing new models with improved characteristics drive higher demand in the market?
